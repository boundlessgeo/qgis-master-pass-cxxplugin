Installation
============

The |current_plugin| is a core plugin in |BLQGIS|'s QGIS and does not need to be installed.

If, at some point, you can't see the plugin's menu entries, make sure it is activated. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins`, and in the :guilabel:`Installed` tab make sure the plugin's checkbox is enabled.
