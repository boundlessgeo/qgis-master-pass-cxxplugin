Master Password Helper documentation
====================================

|current_plugin| is a C++ QGIS plugin to store and synchronize QGIS's master password in the user's operating system's Wallet/keyChain/Password Manager. Using this plugin, the user no longer needs to repeatedly type the master password inside QGIS, as the system stores it and uses it whenever is required.

.. note::

   The plugin is only helpful if the user stores his credentials in QGIS's encrypted authentication system.
